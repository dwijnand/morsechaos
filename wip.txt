 there are many possibilities to decode this dashes and dots and get this text

 the first method is to do it by hand

 i mean grouping symbols and trying to get letters from that and then trying to form words with the letters

 the main problem is that sometimes the same dashes and dots array can form different words

 and you can only get the right one trying all possibilities

 in this handy way it may be useful that you look for some common words or expressions that you expect to find

 such as solution congratulations or good job

 you can even have a lucky day if you find something like the solution is extrapolation

 but the problem is that this is not the case

 the other way to solve this seem to wait computer program theories different combinations of letters

 using a backtracking algorithm the program should be clever enough to avoid some wrong patterns

 for example if there are three dashes your program could think that there are built be there week that

 this is wrong because in normal english it is very strange to find three letters

 too five this care of things

 reduces the number of combinations that there are still too many possibilities

 the revising to not network plus an loved an lost mecca

 grams
 frequencies

 and you can solve this automatically and now what you are looking for is the number of letters multiplied by

 this join all later valid if this can save a plateau the value of one and there at it

 adds value of twenty six after saying the ehrhardt must

 keep writing a bit to make people think that this text is too long to solve

 by such md will tell you hope solved contact were used

 thought it was binary encoded it is easy to think that each don sight

 and if you find the method of reading you have in a line too many ways

 rates are spiral circles write every direction that

 nothing worked so i detailed that it was not binary

 after analyzing other challenges from the same author i noticed that they are always easy methods of encoding

 so i did not try

 complex operations and things like that well inserted the enough for the to order your unless

 you can ask me how the story continues i hope you enjoyed this challenge
