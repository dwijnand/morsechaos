 there are many possibilities to decode this dashes and dots and get this text

 the first method is to do it by hand

 i mean grouping symbols and trying to get letters from that and then trying to form words with the letters

 the main problem is that sometimes the same dashes and dots array can form different words

 and you can only get the right one trying all possibilities

 in this handy way it may be useful that you look for some common words or expressions that you expect to find

 such as solution congratulations or good job

 you can even have a lucky day if you find something like the solution is extrapolation

 but the problem is that this is not the case

 the other way to solve this is to make a computer program theories different combinations of letters using a
  backtracking algorithm

 the program should be clever enough to avoid some wrong patterns

 for example if there are three dashes your program could think that there are three times there week that

 this is wrong because in normal english it is very strange to find three letters t together

 this care of things reduces the number of combinations but there are still too many possibilities

 thus it is up to you

 work plus an loved an lost mecca grams frequencies

 and you can solve this automatically

 and now what you are looking for is
 the number of letters
 multiplied by
 the sum of all letter values in this text
 having letter a the value of one
 and the letter z the value of twenty six



 after saying this i think it must keep writing a bit

 to make people think that this text is too long to solve by hand

 so i will tell you how i solved contact

 at first i thought it was binary encoded

 it is easy to think that each don sight

 and if you find the method of reading you have in a line too many ways

 rates are spiral circles write every direction that

 nothing worked so i decided that it was not binary

 after analyzing other challenges from the same author i noticed that they are always easy methods of encoding

 so i did not try complex operations and things like that

 well in since the

 enough for the moment

 if you read this you can ask me how the story continues

 i hope you enjoyed this challenge
